                Emerging from the creative London jazz scene, EMRYS are a trio of unique young artists crafting original jazz music. Drawing from a shared love of Jazz, Classical, Choral and Folk music, their compositions inspire flowing musical landscapes, inviting reflection and rediscovery. Named after the wise folkloric figure of EMRYS (Merlin), the trio are led by the guiding force of their music and the unity of creating it together.
